	0.55 has been tested on Windows, Ubuntu and Fedora, using
	various nVidia boards.

	Previous releases havce been tested with Mesa 3.0.

	
	It is intended that it supports:
	
	OpenGL 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 (some? most?). (And various extensions).
	
	GLU (unknown version). Several (important to nurbs) functions are not
	supported yet.
	
	GLUT, with full support up to API version 3.
	
	GLX is only supported to the degree that Stan's original module
	supported it. Without an entire X binding it is of limited use, and I
	recommend using glut or Gtk::GLArea instead.


	Most functions that have no pointer arguments are called identically in
	Perl as in C, and the same name is used. Functions that use array
	arguments and have been changed in "the obvious way" -- to take a
	variable number of arguments and/or to return an array -- have the
	the same names as their C counterparts, but with a _p suffix.
	
	All functions that take pointers are available with their original
	calling syntax and a _c suffix. These are most useful when combined with
	the OpenGL::Array module, which lets you allocate C arrays from Perl.
	
	A third variant, _s, exists for most pointer functions, and takes a string
	argument for each pointer. The underlying OpenGL function will be passed
	a pointer to that string.
