	Improve diagnostic output for better debugging of CPAN test results,
		Maybe enable verbose logging by default as a start.
	
	Fix test output to use Test::More and result in a clear pass/fail
		CPAN testers report PASS when the test never got to run.
		Needed to support useful automated testing.
	
	Modify example/ programs to use glut functions rather than the
		OpenGL-0.4 defaults with glp*() functions.  We need to
		make some simple defaults for the various glut callbacks
		to simplify coding.

	Add Geometry Shader support.

	Fix GLU implementation - particularly Tesselation.

	Move test apps to t/ subdirectory from test.pl
		Split into interactive and non-interactive tests
		Skip interactive tests if no OpenGL context

	Implement safe glutInit by checking _done_glutInit before calling glutInit()

	Fix GLUT error handling for perl:
		Add croak on no glutInit to glut functions to prevent exit(1)
		Add croak to glutDisplayFunc() with null callback.
		Add croak to glutSetKeyRepeat() with invalid repeat mode
		Add croak to glutSetCursor() with unknown cursor type
		Investigate use of undef return for errors; 1 instead of void's

	Add toggle & display of OpenGL errors a la glutReportErrors()

	Finish perl bindings to remaining FreeGLUT functions:
		glutGetMenuData, glutSetMenuData, glutGetWindowData, glutSetWindowData,
		glutGetProcAddress, glutJoystickFunc, glutWireSierpinskiSponge,
		glutSolidSierpinskiSponge, glutWMCloseFunc
	
	Improve support for non-standard OpenGL configurations:
		Document how to edit Makefile.PL (e.g. lines #120, #132 for lib stuff)
		Add command line options for perl Makefile.PL to set CFLAGS,...
		Make single point override for INCLUDE info.

	Recognize OpenGLUT as an allowed flavor of FreeGLUT for POGL config/compile.

	Clean up existing use of configuration information:
		Clean up compile and config results so they are unambiguous
		Use the same information to build POGL as to build glversion
		Refactor Makefile.PL to be more comprehensible.
	
	Consider move to Module::Build from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to improve build
		configuration process and portability.
	
	Convert malloc() and calloc() calls to Newx(), Newxc(), and Newxz() from
		the perl API.  Convert free() to Safefree() to match.
	
	Document and implement a test matrix for regression and stability testing for
		POGL.  The matrix of factors to include: perl vs activeperl, GLX vs WGL,
		hardware vs software/Mesa, OS, and relevant versions applicable to each.
	
	Investigate a "compile and link only" install of POGL
