PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl::OpenGL is a development version of the
Perl OpenGL (POGL) module for the purposes of evaluating the implementation
for the Perl Data Language integration.  This version is based on
0.57 POGL.  The features developer in this module will be folded into
the OpenGL software at which point this release sequence will be
superceded by that module.

See the OpenGL module if you need Perl OpenGL bindings.  Thanks.
