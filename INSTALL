 This module is a testing and integration version of POGL only.
 See POGL for the official release.  This interface will likely
 change radically before the full POGL functionality is
 integrated with PDL.  Thanks!

 To install the OpenGL module, please follow these instructions:

 1. Update your development environment with the latest OpenGL header
    and lib files.  If you are using a GPU, get the latest drivers
    from your vendor.

    Install FreeGLUT (or compatible) - you can find this at
    http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/.

    On Windows, FreeGLUT is installed automatically by this module if
    needed.  On Mac OS X (Leopard and newer), GLUT is built in.  On
    Linux distributions FreeGLUT is available via their package
    installers.

    The 'include' subfolder provided with this module contains headers
    that this module has been tested with.

    This module looks for libGL.so, libGLU.so and libglut.so
    (opengl32.dll, glu32.dll and freeglut.dll on Windows) in the normal
    places for your OS installation; you may need to symlink libraries
    from various vendors to the proper place/names.

    Note: it is strongly recommended, but not required, that you
    install PerlMagick (6.3.5 or newer) first, as this will
    dramatically simplify and enhance your ability/performance in
    loading/saving images/textures via OpenGL::Image - see INSTALL
    note in the OpenGL::Image module.

 
 2. Run 'perl Makefile.PL'

    Makefile.PL attempts to detemine your OS and available libs.
    You can override these defaults by specifying:

        perl Makefile.PL interface=XFACE [verbose]

    where XFACE is one of the following constants:

        FREEGLUT		Default window interface
        GLUT			Fallback if FreeGLUT is not available
        GLX			Unix X11
        W32API			Windows via CYGWIN
        AGL			Mac OS X
        
    Makefile.PL will attempt to build and run a glversion utility to
    determine what version and extensions your OpenGL installation
    supports, and will create an gl_exclude.h header file to exclude
    APIs your libraries do not support.  You can manually edit this
    file to override excluded extensions.

    The "verbose" option provides additional info for troubleshooting.

    Note: glversion assumes libGL.so and libglut.so
    (opengl32.dll and freeglut.dll on Windows) - and that it will
    be run via a GUI window (eg. X11 on Unix).  This will impact
    automated build systems.


    For building POGL without extension exclusions, use:

        perl Makefile.PL dist=NO_EXCLUSIONS

    Note: NO_EXCLUSIONS is the default for Windows; this can be
    overridden by using the EXCLUSIONS option.


    To install in non-standard locations, use the PREFIX and LIB options
    when generating the Makefiles:

        perl Makefile.PL prefix=/PREFIXPATH [LIB=/PREFIXPATH/perl/lib]

    where PREFIXPATH is the path of the directory where you wish
    the module to be installed (e.g. binary executables in /PREFIXPATH/bin,
    manual pages in /PREFIXPATH/man, library files in /PREFIXPATH/lib...).
    The LIB option allows you to control where the perl module stuff goes
    rather than the default /PREFIXPATH/lib/perl5).

    Then either set the PERL5LIB environment variable before you run
    scripts that use the modules/libraries (see perlrun) or in your
    programs say:
 
      use lib '/PREFIXPATH/perl/lib';


 3. Run 'make' ('nmake' on Windows) to build OpenGL.pm.

 
 4. Run 'make test' ('nmake test' on Windows) to test your
    installation.  You must have GLUT installed in order to run
    this test.  You should see a spinning cube with textured surfaces.
    Press 'q' to quit/complete the test (the test window must have focus).

    Note: Automated builds will normally fail this test, as it requires
    the ability to open a GL context (window) and provide user input.

 
 5. If all is well, run 'sudo make install' ('nmake install on Windows')
    to intall the OpenGL module onto your system.


 6. It is recommended (not required) that you also install the OpenGL::Image
    and OpenGL::Shader modules to enhance POGL's features.


Read the included README files for additional notes on your particular
platform.


If you get an error about __eprintf missing, add

   -L/opt/gnu/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/2.96/ -lgcc

to the @LIBS initializer in Makefile.PL (change the directory for the
appropriate one for your system).
